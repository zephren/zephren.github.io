                                <h1 id="comments">Comments</h1>
<p>The ability to write good comments is an invaluable tool to have under your belt. Whether it is code that you have written, or code that others have written, everyone will be doing a service to themselves and others by writing effective comments about their code. This section will touch on different types of comments and ways of commenting, and how to effectively use them.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-comments">What are Comments</h2>
<p>In their most basic form, comments are a way of adding information to your code that will in no way every be executed.</p>
<p>Imagine writing and editing an essay. As you write your essay you will likely be using other sources to back up an argument or information that you are including in it, and they will need to be cited somewhere outside the body of the essay. Or, as you read through your essay, after writing the first draft, you may notice spelling, grammar, and punctuation issues. And as you see these issues you may be inclined to notate somewhere near them as a reminder to yourself to go back and make changes when you work on your next draft.</p>
<p>Both the citations and notations around mistakes are akin to code comments. As citations and notations for mistakes do not change the content that you have written in your essay, they do serve as a reference for someone else or yourself when you revisit your essay at a later time (this could be a few seconds if you&apos;re on a roll, or just before the essay is due if your a procrastinator).</p>
<p>Just as citations and notations do not change your essay, code comments do not change a program; they simply serve as a reminder to yourself and others for why you have done something the way you have (for good or bad), how something works (possibly referencing a website with more information), or even reminders for possible future enhancements to the program. Or if you&apos;re feeling cheeky, comments can be used for a bit of humor for other programmers to find one day (an older version of you included).</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: A fair amount of this section will be subjective, so read it with an open mind and come to your own conclusions about you think makes for good comments in code. Finding a balance between what works well for you, but also others reading your code, can be a challenging task.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-comments">Types of Comments</h2>
<p>In JS there are two types of comments: line comments, and block comments. I feel like this is a good place for a joke here, but sadly nothing good is coming to mind.</p>
<h3 id="line-comments">Line comments</h3>
<p>This type of comment looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// I am a comment, and I do nothing other than communicate information to someone reading me.</span>
</code></pre>
<p>These comments are often found on their own line, but can also be included at the end of a line. If you are going to write a line comment, I will advocate for always doing it directly above the line (or lines) that it pertains to.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// Adding &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, this is probably obvious, but this is also an example...</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> sum = a + b
</code></pre>
<p>This can also be done as:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> sum = a + b <span class="hljs-comment">// Adding &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, this is probably obvious, but this is also an example...</span>
</code></pre>
<p>But again, I&apos;m going to ask that you avoid this where possible. I am of the opinion that putting the comment above the code helps reduce cognitive load.</p>
<h3 id="block-comments">Block Comments</h3>
<p>This type of comment looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">/*
I am also a comment, but slightly cooler...
because I can span multiple lines.
This makes reading me a good bit easier when there is a lot of information to convey.
*/</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Like the comment itself mentions, these are usually used when you need to explain something by going in depth or using a significant number of words. They also allow you to easily give examples of code within the comment, which will be demonstrated later.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">/*
I have no idea how this works, but it does.
I copied and pasted it from &quot;crazycode.com/get-it-done&quot; and it just worked.
SO as a warning to anyone reading this... DO NOT TOUCH OR YOU WILL BREAK THE UNIVERSE
*/</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> wtf = ((<span class="hljs-number">4</span> &gt;&gt; <span class="hljs-number">5</span> + <span class="hljs-number">6</span>) &lt;&lt; <span class="hljs-number">2</span> | <span class="hljs-number">42</span>) ^ <span class="hljs-number">1024</span>
</code></pre>
<h2 id="what-to-talk-about-in-comments">What to Talk About in Comments</h2>
<p>There is nothing stopping you from putting whatever you&apos;re in the mood for inside a comment, but I will try and give you a few guidelines to help you be productive with them.</p>
<h3 id="why-did-i-do-this">Why (did I do this)</h3>
<p>Often with new problems you may not know how best to approach a solution to them, so you try your best with what you do know. You might easily recognize that you are not solving the problem in an optimal way, so a constructive comment might explain why you&apos;re doing what you&apos;re doing, and suggest to the reader that it might be improved upon. On the other hand if you are a more experienced programmer you might want to leave notes for others that might be less experienced, and explain why you made the choices you made and why they are good choices.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-do-this-or-i-did-this">How (to do this) or (I did this)</h3>
<p>These types of comments talk about how to use something. This something could be a (library)[../appendix/glossary.md#library] that someone else has written, or code that you have written that exists elsewhere. It could even explain the approach you&apos;ve taken to accomplish whatever it is you set out to do.</p>
<h3 id="todo">Todo</h3>
<p>This is often used in a comment as a reminder that something is non-existent and needs to be written, that is it incomplete, or that it works as it is, but could use improvement.</p>
<h3 id="thats-not-all">That&apos;s Not All</h3>
<p>There are a number of other ways to use comments, which will be covered in the intermediate section.</p>
<h2 id="final-comments-get-it">Final Comments (get it...)</h2>
<p>I will allow you one exception for adding comments in less desireable ways. And that is to get a feel for how comments work when added to your code by experimenting with where they can be added. Ultimately though your goal should be to find what works best for you and anyone you might work with.</p>
