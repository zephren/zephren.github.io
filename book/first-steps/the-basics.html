                                <h1 id="the-basics">The Basics</h1>
<p>Any programing language is about having a bunch of small pieces of knowledge about how the language works (and how programs work in general). These little piece of knowledge are often referred to as &quot;tools&quot;. The more tools you have, the more you can do. You will be able to use these tools in ever increasing combinations with each other to produce better, smarter, and more efficient programs. So let&apos;s jump right into building up your box of tools; the first one of which you have already used.</p>
<h2 id="seeing-something-happen">Seeing Something Happen</h2>
<p>This first tool has a lot more going on than I will cover initially, so I&apos;ll just ask that you use it as I am giving it to you and, for now, simply accept that it does what we need it to. It will be covered later more in depth once you understand some additional concepts.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log()
</code></pre>
<p>This line written as is will technically do something, though you wont actually be able to see the result. To make it ever so slightly more interesting let&apos;s put something between the parentheses.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-number">42</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>If you run this example in your editor, you will see the number 42 appear in your output.</p>
<p>All we did here was tell JS to output (or <strong>log</strong>) a <strong>number</strong>, and thats exactly what it did. You can log literally anything (except [keywords]) in JS, and this will be very handy when you find that your program is not working as you expect. We will cover more about console.log in future sections, but for now feel free to play with logging things to the console. Here are a few examples that will make more sense shortly:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-number">3.14</span>)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">&apos;This is a string&apos;</span>)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="code-in-your-head">Code in Your Head</h2>
<p>Something that will come with experience will be the critically important ability to run/execute the code you are looking at in your head. This is just another tool that you will develop over time. If you are now able to look at a line like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">&apos;This puts something in the console&apos;</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>And can then imagine that text appearing in your output, then you&apos;re already on your way.</p>
<h2 id="">???</h2>
<p>You may ask yourself (or try to ask me, to which I will have no reply as I cannot hear you) things like:</p>
<p>1) Can I do it this way?
2) Why do I have to do it this way?
3) I don&apos;t like how this works, can I do it differently?</p>
<p>And to answer those questions:</p>
<p>1) Maybe, but probably not.
2) Because that&apos;s how it is done.
3) Again, maybe, there are a lot of ways to do the same thing in JavaScript, as you will learn over time.</p>
<p>I will attempt to make it clear why things are done the way they are and try to give you some ways to help remember these things.</p>
<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
<p>Let me start with another metaphor. Imagine you have an index card. There are two things you can do with this index card:</p>
<p>1) Give it a title/name.
2) Write some information (also called a <strong>value</strong>) on it.</p>
<p>When you are writing on this index card you are using a pen for the name and a pencil for the value. Once you&apos;ve written the name, it cannot be changed. However since you wrote the value in pencil, there is nothing stopping you from changing it whenever you want. Use that mental model for now as we talk about variables.</p>
<h3 id="name">Name</h3>
<p>The name of a variable can be whatever you want with a few restrictions:</p>
<p>1) It should only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
2) It cannot begin with a number (but may contain numbers).
3) It cannot contain any spaces.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions to other characters that you can use for variable names (you can even use emoji... try it out to get it out of your system, but please, never ever do it for a real program), but at this point there is no reason you should need to use anything other than letters and numbers. I won&apos;t event be using underscores in my examples.</p>
<p>You will see me use what is called camel case. This just refers to using multiple words in the name of a variable, removing the spaces, and capitalizing the first letter of each word after the first word. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>theNumber</li>
<li>theBestString</li>
<li>aTacoTruck</li>
<li>samsCafe</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="value">Value</h3>
<p>Here is a variable with just a name:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myFirstVariable
</code></pre>
<p>Think of it as having no value, or that you have an index card with just a name at the top, but you haven&apos;t written any value down on it. You can either give the variable a value immediately after giving it a name, or you can set it aside and give it a value later. Either way, you will need to use the equals sign to assign a value to a variable. Here are both of those options, respectively:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myFirstVariable = <span class="hljs-number">42</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myFirstVariable
myfirstVariable = <span class="hljs-number">42</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now would be a good time to mention that most code is executed from right to left. Meaning the value on the right of the equals sign will be assigned to the variable on the left. It absolutely will not work the other way, by having the value on the left and the variable name on the right.</p>
<h2 id="types">Types</h2>
<h3 id="numbers">Numbers</h3>
<p>There are two types of numbers: integers and floats. There are limits to the rang of numbers you can represent, so keep in mind if you try to use a number that is too large, too small, or even just right, you might see some weird behavior from your program.</p>
<h3 id="integer">Integer</h3>
<p>An integer is any whole number. You can represent whole numbers well over a trillion, but if you get too high or too low, and add or subtract from those numbers, you&apos;ll notice that your value doesn&apos;t change at all. I&apos;ll leave it up to you to figure out what the actual integer limits are.</p>
<h3 id="float">Float</h3>
<p>A float is any number with some decimal place. You will definitely encounter The weirdness with floats at some point while running your code. To demonstrate this, run the following line:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-number">2.2</span> + <span class="hljs-number">1.1</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>You&apos;ll see that what gets output it <strong>almost</strong> what you wanted, but computers have their limits with how they can represent numbers. Just like the integer has an upper an lower limit it can represent, floats have fractions of numbers that they can&apos;t quite represent. But they do try to get as close as possible.</p>
<h3 id="character">Character</h3>
<p>A character is a single letter or symbol (for example anything that you can see on your keyboard can be a character)</p>
<h3 id="string">String</h3>
<p>A string is a series of characters. If that sentence doesn&apos;t quite make sense, try to imagine popcorn lined up with a single strand of thread connecting each piece of popcorn. On each piece of popcorn you can write a single character. Together all the pieces of popcorn make up a string. This could be a sentence, a person&apos;s name, or a color. A string can be anything you can create by typing on your keyboard.</p>
<h3 id="boolean">Boolean</h3>
<p>A boolean is is a true or false value.</p>
<h2 id="math">Math</h2>
<p>If you ran the console.log above, you&apos;ve already done a bit of math in JS. Math in most programming languages is the same, with the same operators that you might have used in a math class: <strong>+</strong> <strong>-</strong> <strong>*</strong> <strong>/</strong> <strong>(</strong> <strong>)</strong>. There is a concept that is worth understanding called [order of operations]. This is simply the order in which each mathematical operator gets used. Rather than trying to explain this concept to you, try playing around with adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing some numbers. If you don&apos;t get the result you might have expected try figuring out what order things happened in to give you the result you got, and then add some parentheses to get the result you were originally expecting. Heres an example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-number">1</span> + <span class="hljs-number">2</span> * <span class="hljs-number">3</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>You might expect this to give you 9:</p>
<p>1) 1 + 2 = 3
2) 3 * 3 = 9</p>
<p>But you actually get 7. What is happening is that the multiplication is occurring before the addition:</p>
<p>1) 2 * 3 = 6
2) 1 + 6 = 7</p>
<p>To get 9 you simply need to add parentheses around the addition:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log((<span class="hljs-number">1</span> + <span class="hljs-number">2</span>) * <span class="hljs-number">3</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Parentheses always take the highest precedence when doing math.</p>
