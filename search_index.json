It is not required that you know or understand these terms as they are introduced, but they will help you be able to communicate with others mor effectively.

There are tons of tools available on the internet for testing out JS; however, many of them incorporate HTML and CSS. We will focus on those later and don't need to worry about them right now. For now I will recommend that you use the following site/tool:\nhttps://jscomplete.com/repl\nThis page on this site let's you only write and run JS.\nOnce you've got that opened up type put the following into the left editor area:\n\nconsole.log('My first line of JavaScript');\n\nThen click he play button or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter. This will run the JS you have in the left column. And you will be able to see the output in the right column.\nGoing forward, any place that you type code will be called \"your editor\" and the place where you see output will be aptly called \"your output\" or \"the console\" (yep, that's related to the console.log from above).\n"},"book/first-steps/the-basics.html":{"url":"book/first-steps/the-basics.html","title":"The Basics","keywords":"","body":"The Basics\nAny programing language is about having a bunch of small pieces of knowledge about how the language works (and how programs work in general). These little piece of knowledge are often referred to as \"tools\". The more tools you have, the more you can do. You will be able to use these tools in ever increasing combinations with each other to produce better, smarter, and more efficient programs. So let's jump right into building up your box of tools; the first one of which you have already used.\nSeeing Something Happen\nThis first tool has a lot more going on than I will cover initially, so I'll just ask that you use it as I am giving it to you and, for now, simply accept that it does what we need it to. It will be covered later more in depth once you understand some additional concepts.\nconsole.log()\n\nThis line written as is will technically do something, though you wont actually be able to see the result. To make it ever so slightly more interesting let's put something between the parentheses.\nconsole.log(42)\n\nIf you run this example in your editor, you will see the number 42 appear in your output.\nAll we did here was tell JS to output (or log) a number, and thats exactly what it did. You can log literally anything (except [keywords]) in JS, and this will be very handy when you find that your program is not working as you expect. We will cover more about console.log in future sections, but for now feel free to play with logging things to the console. Here are a few examples that will make more sense shortly:\nconsole.log(3.14)\n\nconsole.log('This is a string')\n\nconsole.log(true)\n\nCode in Your Head\nSomething that will come with experience will be the critically important ability to run/execute the code you are looking at in your head. This is just another tool that you will develop over time. If you are now able to look at a line like:\nconsole.log('This puts something in the console')\n\nAnd can then imagine that text appearing in your output, then you're already on your way.\n???\nYou may ask yourself (or try to ask me, to which I will have no reply as I cannot hear you) things like:\n1) Can I do it this way?\n2) Why do I have to do it this way?\n3) I don't like how this works, can I do it differently?\nAnd to answer those questions:\n1) Maybe, but probably not.\n2) Because that's how it is done.\n3) Again, maybe, there are a lot of ways to do the same thing in JavaScript, as you will learn over time.\nI will attempt to make it clear why things are done the way they are and try to give you some ways to help remember these things.\nVariables\nLet me start with another metaphor. Imagine you have an index card. There are two things you can do with this index card:\n1) Give it a title/name.\n2) Write some information (also called a value) on it.\nWhen you are writing on this index card you are using a pen for the name and a pencil for the value. Once you've written the name, it cannot be changed. However since you wrote the value in pencil, there is nothing stopping you from changing it whenever you want. Use that mental model for now as we talk about variables.\nName\nThe name of a variable can be whatever you want with a few restrictions:\n1) It should only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.\n2) It cannot begin with a number (but may contain numbers).\n3) It cannot contain any spaces.\nThere are a few exceptions to other characters that you can use for variable names (you can even use emoji... try it out to get it out of your system, but please, never ever do it for a real program), but at this point there is no reason you should need to use anything other than letters and numbers. I won't event be using underscores in my examples.\nYou will see me use what is called camel case. This just refers to using multiple words in the name of a variable, removing the spaces, and capitalizing the first letter of each word after the first word. Here are a few examples:\n\ntheNumber\ntheBestString\naTacoTruck\nsamsCafe\n\nValue\nHere is a variable with just a name:\nvar myFirstVariable\n\nThink of it as having no value, or that you have an index card with just a name at the top, but you haven't written any value down on it. You can either give the variable a value immediately after giving it a name, or you can set it aside and give it a value later. Either way, you will need to use the equals sign to assign a value to a variable. Here are both of those options, respectively:\nvar myFirstVariable = 42\n\nvar myFirstVariable\nmyfirstVariable = 42\n\nNow would be a good time to mention that most code is executed from right to left. Meaning the value on the right of the equals sign will be assigned to the variable on the left. It absolutely will not work the other way, by having the value on the left and the variable name on the right.\nTypes\nNumbers\nThere are two types of numbers: integers and floats. There are limits to the rang of numbers you can represent, so keep in mind if you try to use a number that is too large, too small, or even just right, you might see some weird behavior from your program.\nInteger\nAn integer is any whole number. You can represent whole numbers well over a trillion, but if you get too high or too low, and add or subtract from those numbers, you'll notice that your value doesn't change at all. I'll leave it up to you to figure out what the actual integer limits are.\nFloat\nA float is any number with some decimal place. You will definitely encounter The weirdness with floats at some point while running your code. To demonstrate this, run the following line:\nconsole.log(2.2 + 1.1)\n\nYou'll see that what gets output it almost what you wanted, but computers have their limits with how they can represent numbers. Just like the integer has an upper an lower limit it can represent, floats have fractions of numbers that they can't quite represent. But they do try to get as close as possible.\nCharacter\nA character is a single letter or symbol (for example anything that you can see on your keyboard can be a character)\nString\nA string is a series of characters. If that sentence doesn't quite make sense, try to imagine popcorn lined up with a single strand of thread connecting each piece of popcorn. On each piece of popcorn you can write a single character. Together all the pieces of popcorn make up a string. This could be a sentence, a person's name, or a color. A string can be anything you can create by typing on your keyboard.\nBoolean\nA boolean is is a true or false value.\nMath\nIf you ran the console.log above, you've already done a bit of math in JS. Math in most programming languages is the same, with the same operators that you might have used in a math class: + - * / ( ). There is a concept that is worth understanding called [order of operations]. This is simply the order in which each mathematical operator gets used. Rather than trying to explain this concept to you, try playing around with adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing some numbers. If you don't get the result you might have expected try figuring out what order things happened in to give you the result you got, and then add some parentheses to get the result you were originally expecting. Heres an example:\nconsole.log(1 + 2 * 3)\n\nYou might expect this to give you 9:\n1) 1 + 2 = 3\n2) 3 * 3 = 9\nBut you actually get 7. What is happening is that the multiplication is occurring before the addition:\n1) 2 * 3 = 6\n2) 1 + 6 = 7\nTo get 9 you simply need to add parentheses around the addition:\nconsole.log((1 + 2) * 3)\n\nParentheses always take the highest precedence when doing math.\n"},"book/first-steps/comments.html":{"url":"book/first-steps/comments.html","title":"Comments","keywords":"","body":"Comments\nThe ability to write good comments is an invaluable tool to have under your belt. Whether it is code that you have written, or code that others have written, everyone will be doing a service to themselves and others by writing effective comments about their code. This section will touch on different types of comments and ways of commenting, and how to effectively use them.\nWhat are Comments\nIn their most basic form, comments are a way of adding information to your code that will in no way every be executed.\nImagine writing and editing an essay. As you write your essay you will likely be using other sources to back up an argument or information that you are including in it, and they will need to be cited somewhere outside the body of the essay. Or, as you read through your essay, after writing the first draft, you may notice spelling, grammar, and punctuation issues. And as you see these issues you may be inclined to notate somewhere near them as a reminder to yourself to go back and make changes when you work on your next draft.\nBoth the citations and notations around mistakes are akin to code comments. As citations and notations for mistakes do not change the content that you have written in your essay, they do serve as a reference for someone else or yourself when you revisit your essay at a later time (this could be a few seconds if you're on a roll, or just before the essay is due if your a procrastinator).\nJust as citations and notations do not change your essay, code comments do not change a program; they simply serve as a reminder to yourself and others for why you have done something the way you have (for good or bad), how something works (possibly referencing a website with more information), or even reminders for possible future enhancements to the program. Or if you're feeling cheeky, comments can be used for a bit of humor for other programmers to find one day (an older version of you included).\nDisclaimer: A fair amount of this section will be subjective, so read it with an open mind and come to your own conclusions about you think makes for good comments in code. Finding a balance between what works well for you, but also others reading your code, can be a challenging task.\nTypes of Comments\nIn JS there are two types of comments: line comments, and block comments. I feel like this is a good place for a joke here, but sadly nothing good is coming to mind.\nLine comments\nThis type of comment looks like this:\n// I am a comment, and I do nothing other than communicate information to someone reading me.\n\nThese comments are often found on their own line, but can also be included at the end of a line. If you are going to write a line comment, I will advocate for always doing it directly above the line (or lines) that it pertains to.\n// Adding \"a\" and \"b\", this is probably obvious, but this is also an example...\nvar sum = a + b\n\nThis can also be done as:\nvar sum = a + b // Adding \"a\" and \"b\", this is probably obvious, but this is also an example...\n\nBut again, I'm going to ask that you avoid this where possible. I am of the opinion that putting the comment above the code helps reduce cognitive load.\nBlock Comments\nThis type of comment looks like this:\n/*\nI am also a comment, but slightly cooler...\nbecause I can span multiple lines.\nThis makes reading me a good bit easier when there is a lot of information to convey.\n*/\n\nLike the comment itself mentions, these are usually used when you need to explain something by going in depth or using a significant number of words. They also allow you to easily give examples of code within the comment, which will be demonstrated later.\n/*\nI have no idea how this works, but it does.\nI copied and pasted it from \"crazycode.com/get-it-done\" and it just worked.\nSO as a warning to anyone reading this... DO NOT TOUCH OR YOU WILL BREAK THE UNIVERSE\n*/\nvar wtf = ((4 >> 5 + 6) \nWhat to Talk About in Comments\nThere is nothing stopping you from putting whatever you're in the mood for inside a comment, but I will try and give you a few guidelines to help you be productive with them.\nWhy (did I do this)\nOften with new problems you may not know how best to approach a solution to them, so you try your best with what you do know. You might easily recognize that you are not solving the problem in an optimal way, so a constructive comment might explain why you're doing what you're doing, and suggest to the reader that it might be improved upon. On the other hand if you are a more experienced programmer you might want to leave notes for others that might be less experienced, and explain why you made the choices you made and why they are good choices.\nHow (to do this) or (I did this)\nThese types of comments talk about how to use something. This something could be a (library)[../appendix/glossary.md#library] that someone else has written, or code that you have written that exists elsewhere. It could even explain the approach you've taken to accomplish whatever it is you set out to do.\nTodo\nThis is often used in a comment as a reminder that something is non-existent and needs to be written, that is it incomplete, or that it works as it is, but could use improvement.\nThat's Not All\nThere are a number of other ways to use comments, which will be covered in the intermediate section.\nFinal Comments (get it...)\nI will allow you one exception for adding comments in less desireable ways. And that is to get a feel for how comments work when added to your code by experimenting with where they can be added. Ultimately though your goal should be to find what works best for you and anyone you might work with.\n"},"book/first-steps/everything-is-a-value.html":{"url":"book/first-steps/everything-is-a-value.html","title":"Everything is a Value","keywords":"","body":"Everything is a Value\nThe title of this section is a bit of an over generalization, but not by much. What I'm trying to convey is that almost anything in JavaScript can be assigned to a variable. So technically, almost everything is a value. I'll give a few examples here with things that have been covered up to this point. But the best way to figure out what is and is not a value, and what you can do by assigning it to a variable, is to try it.\nThe Basics\nnumbers, strings, boolean\nCovered Later\nfunctions, objects\nnull, undefined\n"},"book/first-steps/making-decisions.html":{"url":"book/first-steps/making-decisions.html","title":"Making Decisions","keywords":"","body":"Making Decisions\nUp to this point you should be able to write a program that has some variables and can do some math. That is a great starting point, but honestly it's probably not all that interesting yet. As humans, we make many decisions every day, and while not always rational they're most likely founded on some amount of information. Almost all programs make decisions too; however, they are founded entirely on fact. And given the same information, the exact same decision will be made every single time (sadly the same cannot be said for us humans).\nWhat If...\nEvery decision that a computer makes is based on what is called a statement and whether that statement is true, or whether it is false. Everything that is a value in JS can also be considered a true or a false value. Later in this section I've listed out all the types of values and their truthiness. The most common way for a program to make a decision is to use the if statement:\nif () {\n    // Then...\n    \n}\n\nThe structure of an if statement introduces the use of an opening ( { ) and closing ( } ) curly bracket. For the sake of not giving you misinformation, these are not required when used under certain conditions (which we wont get into right now). However, for the purposes of simplicity, think of them as something you must always have when writing an if statement. That way the main structure of your if statement will always be the same. What the curly braces do is allow you to tell JS that the section of code inside them () is only to be executed when the  is true. I don't have a good metaphor for if statements other than they seem to line up with how we as humans can perform actions based on objectively making a decision. For example:\n\nif the baby is crying, then try to comfort the baby.\nif the house is on fire, then get out of the freaking house.\nif the car won't start, then check whether it has any gas.\n\nI'll write these examples out in a moment. But first, here is some code where we are just using the the literal boolean value to show what happens when the statement is true or false:\nSomething that evaluates to true\nif (true) {\n    // The code inside the brackets will execute\n}\n\n// More code, always executed\n\nSomething that evaluates to false\nif (false) {\n    // The code inside the brackets will NOT execute\n}\n\n// More code, always executed\n\nOther examples:\nvar theBabyIsCrying = true;\nif (theBabyIsCrying) {\n    // Do something to comfort the baby\n}\n\nvar theHouseIsOnFire = true;\nif (theHouseIsOnFire) {\n    // Get out of the freaking house\n}\n\nNow is probably a good time to introduce the not operator which is just an exclamation point !. This just takes the opposite of what ever it is next to. So a true value becomes false and a false value becomes true. The not operator always directly precedes whatever it is you want to take the opposite of. So, using the above examples:\nvar theBabyIsCrying = false;\nif (!theBabyIsCrying) {\n    // This is good, you are not distracted by the baby\n    // Go about your business\n}\n\nvar theHouseIsOnFire = false;\nif (!theHouseIsOnFire) {\n    // This is pretty normal\n    // Not a whole lot to do here\n}\n\nTo illustrate the car starting example we need to introduce the else statement. The code contained in the brackets of the else statement will get executed if the if statement evaluates to false.\nif () {\n    // Then...\n    \n} else {\n    // Else\n    \n}\n\nvar theCarStarts = false;\nif (theCarStarts) {\n    // Yay! you can drive wherever it is you wanted to go\n} else {\n    // Check to see if it has any gas\n}\n\nvar theCarStarts = true;\nif (!theCarStarts) {\n    // Check to see if it has any gas\n} else {\n    // Yay! you can drive wherever it is you wanted to go\n}\n\nThe above is the if else statement. From here on I will refer to any combination of if, else, and else if (which you'll see next) generically as an \"if statement\".\nThe last thing to add is the else if statement. Let me preface talking about this by giving you some rules for if statements that are pretty simple:\n1) There must be one, and only one, \"if\" in an if statement\n2) There can optionally be a single \"else\" at the end of in an if statement\n3) There can be zero or more \"else if\" statements preceding an \"if\" statement in an if statement\nThe else if statement lets you add additional things to check should the original if statement evaluate to false. Since you can have multiple else ifs, think of them as being checked in the order in which you have them listed, whichever one evaluates to true first (if any of them) will get its code between its brackets executed.\nI'll give a few examples to hopefully make this more clear:\nif (true) {\n    // Executes\n}\n\nif (true) {\n    // Executed\n} else {\n    // Not executed\n}\n\nif (false) {\n    // Not executed\n} else if (true) {\n    // Executed\n}\n\nif (false) {\n    // Not executed\n} else if (false) {\n    // Not executed\n} else {\n    // Executed\n}\n\nif (false) {\n    // Not executed\n} else if (false) {\n    // Not executed\n} else if (false) {\n    // Not executed\n} else if (true) {\n    // Executed\n} else {\n    // Not executed\n}\n\nNesting\nThe last thing I want to give you is the ability to do what is called nesting. This generally refers to putting code that uses brackets (like if statements) inside some other code that uses brackets (again, like if statements). It's much easier shown than explained with words:\nif (true) {\n    // The following code is executed\n    if (false) {\n        // Not executed\n    } else {\n        // Executed\n        // We cold keep going with the nesting if we wanted to have more conditions\n    }\n} else {\n    // Not executed\n}\n\nvar theHouseIsOnFire = true\nvar theDoorsAreLocked = false\nif (theHouseIsOnFire) { // This is true\n    // Oh no, we'd better get out\n    if (theDoorsAreLocked) { // This is false\n        // If this were true, hopefully we could unlock the doors\n    } else {\n        // Phew, we're able to easily get out of the house\n    }\n} else {\n    // This is just a normal day\n}\n\nBut Wait, There's More\nThis should get you going for now. More advanced and concise decision making will be covered in the intermediate topic. If the idea of not knowing the best way of doing something from the start concerns you, then I can offer this piece of advice:\nOne of the best parts about programming is that if you have done something one way, and then learn a better way to do it, there is nothing stopping you from changing it.\nDepending on what you've done, it may be more or less complicated to change it in the future, but that in and of it self is also part of the leaning process. Over time you will get better at writing code than can be updated, rewritten, and maintained.\n"},"book/first-steps/debugging.html":{"url":"book/first-steps/debugging.html","title":"Debugging","keywords":"","body":"Debugging\nThis will inarguably be the most valuable tool of any programmer. No one writes perfect code that works the first time and that has no flaws. In any language, every programmer will introduce bugs into the code they write. This is just a fact of life. There is a ray of hope however, and that ray is the ability of a programmer to be able to debug their (and others) code.\nHopefully you've been playing with writing some of your own code up to this point, and even more hopefully you've been using console.log to see what it is doing. Even more points if you've run into an issue, and used console.log to help you figure out what was going wrong (by logging out something you might not normally have).\nIf you have not happened to try this out, then I hope you find the next few sections enlightening into the ways of debugging and benefit of mastering it as a skill.\nWhat is a Bug\nFor as long as I have been writing code, I will still find myself introducing bugs relatively frequently. Most of the time they will be caught through manual and automated testing. As I write this, I am trying to come up with some examples of bugs, but finding it difficult to intentionally introduce one that might be a common beginners mistake.\nHow to Debug\nPractice. Practice. Practice. You will see errors or unexpected behavior in your programs and then have to figure out why the thing that is happening is happening. There are a few common types of bugs you might run into.\nSyntax Errors\nThese are usually the easiest to fix. There are a lot of code editors out there, and most of them will support syntax highlighting as well code analysis to let you know that when you have written some code that it knows just will not work. If you are not using one of these more advanced editors then whatever is running your code will immediately inform you of syntax errors and stop trying to run your program. The solution is usually as simple as correcting your code.\nRun Time Errors\nThese errors can be a little harder to track down. You will definitely see an error output in the console for these types of errors. And while the output will definitely tell you what happened, it can be harder to track down why it happened.\nLogic Errors\nThese are definitely the trickiest to figure out. These present themselves as unexpected behavior, so you won't see any error output to the console.\n"},"book/intermediate-topics.html":{"url":"book/intermediate-topics.html","title":"Intermediate Topics","keywords":"","body":""},"book/intermediate-topics/arrays.html":{"url":"book/intermediate-topics/arrays.html","title":"Arrays","keywords":"","body":"Arrays\nArrays are actually quite simple. You quite use them every day without actually realizing it. You can think of literally anything that is a list as an array. You might make a list of strings, a todo list. Or a list of numbers, an expense report. You can easily add an remove items from either of these lists as you either complete items or spend more money. Here are some JS arrays:\nvar emptyArray = []\nvar anArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nvar aStringArray = [\n    'I',\n    'Love',\n    'Arrays!'\n]\nvar mixedArray = [\n    42,\n    'Six',\n    777,\n    'Why would you do this?',\n    3.14\n]\n\nLet's use this array for the next for examples:\nvar expenses = [\n    4.78,\n    77.89,\n    20.50,\n    9.99,\n    86.90\n]\n\nView Items\n// This will output the entire array\nconsole.log(expenses)\n\nYou can measure arrays:\n// .length tells you how many items are in the array\n// In the case of expenses, 5\nconsole.log(expenses.length)\n\nYou can access items in an array. Items are accessed by their \"index\". The index is simply a number that indicates an items position in an array, and they always start at 0 for the first item. You can think of the index as the number of items away from the first item it is. So the first item is 0 items away from the first item! The second item is 1 item away from the first item. And so on.\n// Using the original array, output each of the items\n// There are much better ways of doing this which you'll see soon\nconsole.log(expenses[0])\nconsole.log(expenses[1])\nconsole.log(expenses[2])\nconsole.log(expenses[3])\nconsole.log(expenses[4])\n\nAdd/Change Items\nYou can add items to an array. The term of this is pushing something onto an array. Imagine a stack of things that is just slightly taller than you are, if you want to add something to it, you're going to have to reach up and \"push\" it on to the array.\n// We just made a new purchase, so add it\nexpenses.push(5.99)\nconsole.log(expenses.length)\n\nYou can also change an item at a specific index. Let's add 10.00 to the 9.99 item.\nexpenses[3] += 10.00\n\nconsole.log(expenses[3])\n\nRemove Items\nLet's say we returned the 77.89 item and we want to remove it from the array. We do this by using the splice function. It's not the best name to describe what it does (though it can do more than remove a single item). Splice removes \"y\" items, starting from position \"x\".\narray.splice(x, y)\n\n// The item we want to remove is at index 1,\n// and we only want to remove the one item\nexpenses.splice(1, 1)\n\nconsole.log(expenses.length)\nconsole.log(expenses)\n\nIf you specifically want to remove the last item from the array, you can \"pop\" it off. Imagine that it is stuck on the array and when you remove the item at the last index, it \"pops\" off.\nvar poppedItem = array.pop()\nconsole.log(poppedItem)\n\n"},"book/intermediate-topics/objects.html":{"url":"book/intermediate-topics/objects.html","title":"Objects","keywords":"","body":"For the first part of this section we will use the term \"box\" in place of a structure that is called a \"JavaScript object\".\nImagine you have a box. But this is a special box. You can put whatever you want inside this box, and It can be instantly resized to whatever size you need it to be.\nThis is a box (it's empty):\n{}\n\nYou can assign your box to a variable:\nvar box = {};\n\nRemember how this box can instantly be resized to any size you need? Let's see that in action. The best part is that you don't have to do anything other than put things in the box. And label them of course... you don't want to forget what's in the box. Feel free to literally imagine labels on the things you put in the box. Here is the basic structure of a box:\n{\n    'label': 1234,\n}\n\nBoxes are great for structuring and organizing information, and can contain pretty much whatever you want:\nA string:\n{\n    'aString': 'Hi! I'm a string!',\n}\n\nSome numbers:\n{\n    'anInteger': 42,\n    'aFloat': 3.14,\n}\n\nA boolean:\n{\n    aBoolean: true\n}\n\nOther boxes:\n{\n    'anEmptyBox': {},\n    'aBoxWithStuff': {\n        'aString': 'Hi! I'm a string!',\n    'anInteger': 42,\n    'aFloat': 3.14,\n    },\n}\n\nAn array:\n{\n    'anArray': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n}\n\nEven functions:\n{\n    'add': function(a, b) {\n        return a + b\n    },\n}\n\nHere is a practical example of a what you might organize in a box (using a toy box as the example):\nvar toyBox = {\n    'lego': {\n        '2x2': 50,\n        '2x4': 75,\n        '1x2': 30,\n        '1x4': 40,\n    },\n    'dolls': {\n        'ken': {\n            'hair': 'brown',\n            'eyes': 'blue',\n        },\n        'barbie': {\n            'hair': 'blonde',\n            'eyes': 'brown',\n        },\n        'elmo': {\n            'hair': 'red',\n            'eyes': 'black',\n        },\n        'giJoe': {\n            'hair': 'black',\n            'eyes': 'black',\n        }\n    },\n    'vehicles': [\n        'Race Car',\n        'Truck',\n        'Plane',\n        'Helicopter',\n    ]\n}\n\nAt this point we will start referring to \"boxes\" by their correct term, \"objects\". And \"labels\" and \"things\" will be referred to as \"properties\" and \"values\". Also, properties do not require quotes around them (unless you want to have a property that is a JavaScript keyword, or starts with a number, or contains an operator), so they won't be used unless necessary.\nObjects are very flexible, but have a very basic structure as covered above. Something worth playing with is how you like to visually structure your objects. The format used above is pretty common, but there's nothing stopping you from putting it all on one line (word wrap prevents it from all being on a single line here, but try copying it into your code editor):\n{'anEmptyBox': {}, 'aBoxWithStuff': {'aString': 'Hi! I\\'m a string!','anInteger': 42, 'aFloat': 3.14}}\n\nNow that you have some objects to work with the next question is probably, \"How do I get stuff out of a box/object?\". It's actually very simple, let's use an example from above. But before jumping into that it is worth mentioning that there are two ways to access the value of a property. Either using dot notation or array \"index\" notation. Array notation can be used to access any property, while dot notation cannot (specifically properties that start with numbers and/or contain operators).\nvar myObject = {\n    anInteger: 42,\n    aFloat: 3.14,\n}\n\nTo get a value from it (using dot notation):\nvar x = myObject.anInteger;\n\n\"x\" would now have the value of 42.\nAnd for a more complex example using the toyBox from above (referencing inner objects):\nvar x = toyBox.dolls.ken.hair; // Dot notation\nvar x = toyBox['dolls']['ken']['hair']; // Array index notation\n\n\"x\" is now \"brown\"\nAnd for using both dot notation and array index notation:\nvar x = toyBox.lego['2x4'];\n\n\"x\" is now 75.\nArray index notation is required for '2x4' here because it starts with a number. The following is NOT VALID syntax:\nvar x = toyBox.lego.2x4; // This will fail to execute\n\nIt is also possible to access an object's property using a variable and array index notation:\nvar a ='2x4';\nvar x = toyBox.lego[a];\n\n\"x\" is again 75\nThe following is valid syntax, but will not give you the value that toyBox.lego[a] will:\nvar a ='2x4';\nvar x = toyBox.lego.a; // \"a\" is not a known property of toyBox.lego\n\nNow that you've seen how to access a value in an object, the next step is to add a property to an object or update a property on an object. This is done simply by placing the object access on the left hand side of the equals operator.\nTo update a property:\ntoyBox.lego['1x2'] = 50;\n\nTo add a property:\ntoyBox.lego['1x6'] = 10;\n\n\f\nUse this object to answer the following questions:\nvar car = {\n    wheels: 4,\n    color: 'red',\n    topSpeed: 88.8,\n    Features: {\n        airBags: 6,\n        bluetooth: false,\n        powerWindows: true,\n        '4x4': true,\n    }\n}\n\nHow would you access the color of the car using dot notation?\nHow would you access the color of the car using array index notation?\nChange the color of the car.\nHow would you access the '4x4' feature of the car (to figure out whether it has that feature or not)?\nIncrease the topSpeed of the car by 10.\nAdd 2 extra air bags to the car.\nAdd the bluetooth feature to the car by 10.\nAdd your own feature to the car!\nBonus:\nHow would you access and \"console.log\" each of the features (assume you don't know what the features are)? Hint: use a \"for loop\".\n"},"book/intermediate-topics/loops.html":{"url":"book/intermediate-topics/loops.html","title":"Loops","keywords":"","body":"Loops\n\n\n\n"},"book/intermediate-topics/functions.html":{"url":"book/intermediate-topics/functions.html","title":"Functions","keywords":"","body":"Functions\nUp until now if you have been playing with JS on your own you have probably found that you were repeating yourself a lot. Maybe checking the same conditions in an if statement in multiple places throughout your code, or logging the same string with multiple variables in more than one place. This is a (non-medical) condition called is called code duplication, and the best cure for it is functions.\nFunctions allow you to break your code up into logical, reusable sections. You also get to give these sections names. When naming a function, it should be something that describes what it does and is hopefully easy to remember.\nFunction Syntax\nStructurally, functions look a little like a single if statement, but have a little more to them and are much more powerful. Let's get some terms out of the way. When you write a function, that is called \"defining\" a function. And when you want to use a function and have it do something, that is called \"calling\" a function.\n// Defining a function\nfunction sayHello() {\n    console.log('Hello!')\n}\n\n// Calling the function\nsayHello()\n\nIf you run this example, you'll see that it simply outputs \"Hello!\". You might be thinking \"well this seems excessive, all it is doing is logging out a string\", and you would be right, it is excessive (unless of course you want to be super friendly and say hello a bunch of times, then it might seem a little more practical). However, the point here is to demonstrate the bare minimum to create a function an have it produce a tangible result. The key here is to realize that you can put anything you want inside a function and then call that function as many times as you would like. This enables you to write some code once and use it as many times as you want, by simply calling your function. Before moving on and making things more interesting, let me give you another metaphor.\nTry to think of a task you do regularly in your every day life. Give it a name, and think of the inputs it requires. These would be materials, tools, or information required to perform your task. Bonus points if it has some sort of result or product... an output. Also think about the steps involved in your task. Keep this task in mind, along with it's inputs, steps, and outputs, as we go through the next few examples.\nNow let's make the above function a little more interesting:\n// Defining a function with a single parameter: whatToSay\nfunction saySomething(whatToSay) {\n    console.log(whatToSay)\n}\n\n// Calling the function with a parameter value of 'Hello!'\nsaySomething('Hello!')\n\n// Calling the function with a parameter value of 'How are you!'\nsaySomething('How are you?')\n\n// Calling the function with a parameter that is a variable\nvar jackSays = 'I can jump!';\nsaySomething(jackSays);\n\nNow we have added what is called a function parameter; this would be one of the inputs to the task I had you think through. Parameters allow you to create variables that are special to the execution of your function, and you can have as many as you would like. If your function has parameters, you need to give those parameters values when you call your function. In the case of the above example, the function seems to expect a string for the first parameter. I say seems because we can pass whatever value(s) we want into any function\nHere is a slightly more practical function (that seems to accept numbers):\nfunction add(numberA, numberB) {\n    return numberA + numberB\n}\n\nvar result1 = add(2, 3)\nvar result2 = add(10, 10)\n\nconsole.log(result1)\nconsole.log(result2)\n\nNow we have two parameters and a return value. The return value is the output to your function, which you are free to do whatever you wish with, like assign it to a variable. The return value is completely optional, and if you do not specify one then it defaults to a value of \"undefined\".\nThat is essentially all there is to functions. A bit (or sometimes a lot) of code that you can reuse wherever you please. It accepts any number of inputs that you choose and and has an optional output. Here are a few more examples:\n// A function to average an array\nfunction averageArray(array) {\n    var total = 0;\n\n    // Total all the items in the array\n    for (var i in array) {\n        total = total + array[i];\n    }\n\n    // Divide the total by the number of items\n    return total / array.length;\n}\n\n// Creating an array\nvar myArray = [2, 5, 6, 9, 17]\n\n// There's no need to assign it to a variable\n// if all that is needed it to output the result\nconsole.log(average(myArray))\n\nOh, and one last thing. Remember how everything is a value? Yep, you can assign functions to variables to:\n// Defining what is called an anonymous function\n// and assigning it to a variable \nvar myFunction = function() {\n    // It does a thing...\n}\n\nmyFunction();\n\nAnd pass functions into other functions:\nvar ifEven = function(number) {\n    console.log(number + ' is even')\n}\n\nvar ifOdd = function(number) {\n    console.log(number + ' is odd')\n}\n\nvar checkEvenOdd = function(number, callIfEven, callIfOdd) {\n    if (number % 2 === 0) {\n        callIfEven(number)\n    } else {\n        callIfOdd(number)\n    }\n}\n\ncheckEvenOdd(5, ifEven, ifOdd)\ncheckEvenOdd(42, ifEven, ifOdd)\ncheckEvenOdd(1987, ifEven, ifOdd)\n\nThis is definitely a contrived example, but it is meant to demonstrate the flexibility of JS.\nFunctions in Functions\nIn JS you can nest functions within functions (...within functions, ad infinitum). This will be important when learning about scope.\n\nfunction logThings() {\n    function simpleLog(string) {\n        console.log(string);\n    }\n\n    simpleLog('This')\n    simpleLog('Is')\n    simpleLog('How')\n    simpleLog('Functions')\n    simpleLog('Within')\n    simpleLog('Functions')\n    simpleLog('Work!')\n}\n\nlogThings()\n\n// This will intentionally fail, to demonstrate that the inner \n// function is not available outside it's container function\nsimpleLog()\n\nOne last point to make about everything being a value. You can return functions from other functions, which will make more sense once you understand scope better. Here we are calling a function to create and return another \"customized\" function. You can then use this function anywhere you have access to the variable to which it is assigned.\n\nfunction createAnAdder(number1, number2) {\n    // This returns a function that will return the added\n    // values of the numbers that are passed in\n    // If this is too confusing, the scope section should\n    // help clear it up\n    return function() {\n        return number1 + number2\n    }\n}\n\n// Assign a function to \"myAdder\" that adds 3 and 4 any time you call it\nvar myAdder = createAnAdder(3, 4);\n\nconsole.log(myAdder());\nconsole.log(myAdder());\nconsole.log(myAdder());\n\n"},"book/intermediate-topics/scope.html":{"url":"book/intermediate-topics/scope.html","title":"Scope","keywords":"","body":"Scope\nIf you feel like you have a grasp on functions, then the next topic to tackle is scope. Scope is a difficult concept to explain with words, so it is probably most easily demonstrated by a few examples:\n\n// This variable is global and in the global scope\nvar aGlobal = 42\n\n// Functions create a new scope when they runs\nfunction myFunction() {\n    // This variable only exists inside this function\n    var aLocal = 'I am local to this function'\n\n    // This variable has the same name, but it's value\n    // only exists inside this function because we're\n    // using \"var\"\n    // It does not overwrite the value of \"aGlobal\" that is declared above\n    var aGlobal = 'I am also local to this function'\n\n    console.log(aLocal)\n    console.log(aGlobal)\n}\n\n// This function also creates it's own scope when it runs\nfunction modifyAGlobal() {\n    // We can modify the global variable by not declaring\n    // a new \"var\"\n    aGlobal = 777\n}\n\nmyFunction()\n\n// Notice how aGlobal is still 42 here\nconsole.log(aGlobal)\n\nmodifyAGlobal()\n\n// Now notice how aGlobal has been modified\nconsole.log(aGlobal)\n\nThe above code demonstrates how each function creates it's own scope, and has access to the scope \"above it\". Scope is relative to the place where the function is defined. This means it doesn't matter where you call a function from, as it will always have access to the scopes above it.\nHere is another example to show this a little differently, with one function calling another.\n// These variables are in the global scope\nvar varA = 1\nvar varB = 2\n\n// These three functions are in the global scope\nfunction functionA() {\n    var varC = 'C'\n}\n\nfunction functionB() {\n    var varD = 'D'\n}\n\nfunction functionC() {\n    var varE = 'E'\n\n    functionA()\n}\n\nFunctions A, B, and C are defined within the global scope, so they are tied to that scope.\n1) If we call functionA, then it has access to the variables varA, varB, and, in it's own scope varC.\n2) If we call functionC, then it has access to the variables varA, varB, and varE. You can also see that it will call functionA... but functionA behaves the same as in #1. It does not have access to anything within functionC, just varA, varB, and varC.\nFunctions have no knowledge about the variables in other functions. Unless you define a function within another function (which we did earlier in the \"functions\" section):\n\n// This function takes an array and adds up all the values,\n// multiplying each value by the length of the array\n// I don't know why you would want to do this, but it demonstrates the point\nfunction weirdMath(theArray) {\n    var total = 0;\n\n    // This function only exists within the scope of weirdMath\n    function addValueTimesLength(value) {\n        total = total + value * theArray.length\n    }\n\n    for (var i in theArray) {\n        addValueTimesLength(theArray[i])\n    }\n\n    return total\n}\n\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]\nconsole.log(weirdMath(myArray))\n\n"},"book/intermediate-topics/special-values.html":{"url":"book/intermediate-topics/special-values.html","title":"Special Values","keywords":"","body":""},"book/intermediate-topics/everything-is-a-value-redux.html":{"url":"book/intermediate-topics/everything-is-a-value-redux.html","title":"Everything is a Value Redux","keywords":"","body":"talk about new things that have been covered up to this point and how they are or are not values, because this is suck an important concept\n"},"book/appendix/glossary.html":{"url":"book/appendix/glossary.html","title":"Glossary","keywords":"","body":"Glossary\nDevelopment Environment\nHTML\n(Hyper Text Markup Language)\nCSS\n(Cascading Style Sheet)\nJSON\n(JavaScript Object Notation)\nKeywords\nThis is a list of all the key words broken down by JavaScript version\nES6\n\nbreak\ncase\ncatch\nclass\nconst\ncontinue\ndebugger\ndefault\ndelete\ndo\nelse\nexport\nextends\nfinally\nfor\nfunction\nif\nimport\nin\ninstanceof\nnew\nreturn\nsuper\nswitch\nthis\nthrow\ntry\ntypeof\nvar\nvoid\nwhile\nwith\nyield\n\nLibrary\nA library is\nMaintainability\nThis is a subjective rating to gauge how maintainable a piece of software is.\nNesting\nNesting is\nTruthiness\nThis is a list of all of the types of values in JS and whether they evaluate to true or false\nThings that evaluate to true\n\ntrue\n1\n-1\n\"All non empty strings\"\n\"false\"\n\"0\"\n\"null\"\n\"undefined\"\n\"NaN\"\n\n\ninfinity\n-infinity\n[]\n{}\n\nThings that evaluate to false\n\nfalse\n0\n\"\" (an empty string)\nnull\nundefined\nNaN\n\n"}}}
